2. REPORT DETAILS

PLCK-58#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Sub-optimal placement for a global clock-capable IO pin and BUFG pair.
Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The global clock-capable IO (GCIO) is placed on a GCIO capable site (b) The BUFG is placed in the same bank of the device as the GCIO pin. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	camera_PCLK_i_IBUF_inst/IBUFCTRL_INST (in camera_PCLK_i_IBUF_inst macro) (IBUFCTRL.O) is locked to G5
	camera_PCLK_i_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFGCE.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCE_X0Y54

Related violations: <none>

PLCK-90#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
A BUFGCE clock buffer whose input is driven by a non IO/Clock element can not be placed in a BUFGCE_HDIO site:
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	camera_PCLK_i_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFGCE.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCE_X0Y54

Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port camera_SCL_b expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#2 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port camera_SDA_b expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>
